# Algorithms and Data Structures Mastery

Welcome to my journey of relearning and mastering algorithms, data structures, and dynamic programming! This repository contains my notes, solutions to problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, and other platforms, and my progress in solving interview-style questions.

I will update this repository regularly as I go through the following topics and solve coding challenges. The goal is to build a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures while practicing problems that frequently appear in technical interviews.
